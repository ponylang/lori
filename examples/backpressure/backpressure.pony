"""
Demonstrates lori's backpressure handling.

A flood client connects to a sink server and sends 200 chunks of 64KB as fast
as possible. When the OS send buffer fills, send() returns
SendErrorNotWriteable and _on_throttled fires. The client stops sending and
waits for _on_unthrottled to resume. _on_sent confirms each chunk was fully
handed to the OS.

Expected output shows the throttle/unthrottle cycle repeating as the client
outpaces the TCP stack.
