## Make Lori callbacks private

All the callbacks on `TCPClientActor`, `TCPServerActor`, and `TCPConnectionActor` have been changed to private from public. This better indicates that the methods are not intended to be called from outside of Lori. To update, you'll need to make the methods on your objects that implement any of the above traits private as well.
