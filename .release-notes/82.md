## Add Windows Support

Windows support has been added to Lori.

All tested functionality is equivalent between Windows and Posix platforms. However, not all untested functionality is guaranteed to be in place as a deeper review of Windows support needs to be done. At minimum, the Windows implementation is currently lacking support for backpressure to be applied when the OS exerts it on a Lori program while it is sending.

Extensive additional work will be done on Windows support, but going forward, Windows will be a first-class Lori platform.
